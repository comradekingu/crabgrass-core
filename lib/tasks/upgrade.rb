#  UPGRADE TASKS
#
# Some data structures have changed over years. These tasks help upgrade them.
#
# They only need to be run once and only when migrating from older versions.
# However, when adding tasks make sure running them again won't hurt.
#
# The tasks themselves are sorted by the crabgrass version that introduced
# them. You will find them in the upgrade subdirectory.
