    # I have decided that using activerecord in migrations should be avoided.
    # It causes more trouble than it is worth: when migrating a database,
    # the model code that is used is based on the very newest database, and if
    # you try to use these models on the old database while it is getting migrated
    # then all sorts of things will likely break.
    # Yes, you could incrementally update the codebase, migrate, then update,
    # but this is a pita.
