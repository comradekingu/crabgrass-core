# Page::Finder
#
# Find pages for short urls such as group/title-of-page
# Used from the ContextPagesController.
#
# When page is called we try to find one page and return it.
# First of all we identify the context of the page as a group or a user.
# If we cannot identify the context we return nil.
#
# We used to try to find pages even if we could not identify the context.
# This is currently broken in production. I'm not sure if it was ever used at
# scale. So I removed this to reduce complexity.

      # as spaces). find by id will always return a globally unique page so we
      # can ignore context
