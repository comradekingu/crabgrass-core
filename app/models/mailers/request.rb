  #  UPGRADE: These have not been ported over to core yet.
  #
  #  Please do so and keep in mind that rails3 has a new Mailer API:
  #
  #  1.)
  #      body :key => value
  #    now is replaced by
  #      @key = value
  #    just like in controllers.
  #  2.)
  #    call mail with subject, to, from at the end.
