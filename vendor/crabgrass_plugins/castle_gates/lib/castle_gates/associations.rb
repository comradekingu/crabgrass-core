# Code that makes it easy to build holders based on Active Record associations
# and relations.
#
# For example CastleGates::Association.new(user, :peers) refers to all the
# peers of the given user.

##
## Association
##

#
# This class is a proxy for the AR relation
#
# This double proxy keeps us from accidently hitting the database
# and fetching the records from the relation.
#
# For example, just the simple statement {@me.minions => :x} will trigger
# fetching all the minions. Instead, we use @me.associated(:minions)
# which will return an Association.
#

  attr_reader :owner, :relationship

  # owner can be a class to refer to all associations of a certain type
  # for instance during definition or an instance to refer to a specific
  # association of a concrete record.
  def initialize(owner, relationship)
    @owner = owner
    @relationship = relationship
