  # For groups and users have two cache keys:
  # * the version based for relationships of the group.
  # * the normal one based on updated_at for the group itself
  #
  # So for example a groups network list is cached based on
  # the version cache_key so it refreshes when one of the
  # networks changes.
  #
  # The display of a network inside that list is based on that
  # networks normal cache key. It changes when the network
  # itself changes.

    # Takes an array of group ids and increments the version of all these

    # that might invalidate something they have cached on their landing page.

    # This method does not need to be called when membership is changed, the
    # version increment for that is already handled elsewhere.
