# A Gate is a protected thing.
#
# It belongs to a GateSet, which belongs to a Castle.
#
# ATTRIBUTES
#
# bit
#
#   Every castle has fixed set of gates in consecutive positions.
#   The gate id determines its position. The bit is a mask for this position.
#
#   For example
#     id    -->    bit
#     0     -->    0001   (reserved, see note in keys.rb)
#     1     -->    0010
#     2     -->    0100
#     3     -->    1000
#     and so on..
#
# fallback
#
#   when no key exists, is the gate open (true), or closed (false)
#
